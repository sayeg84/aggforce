    """Featurize each site via its distance to a mapped site.

    Each fine-grained site is characterized via its distance to the coarse-grained
    site at each frame.

    This function uses JAX for acceleration.

    At each frame, the distances between a coarse-grained site and each
    fine-grained site are calculated. These distances are "binned" by applying a
    series of Gaussians at multiple points along each distance. These binned
    distances are then associated separately to each atom (this is done using a
    one-hot encoding in the feature matrix).

    Fine-grained sites which are constrained together are assigned the same
    position before distance calculation and use the same one-hot slot; as a
    result, they have identical features at each frame.

    Arguments:
    ---------
    points (np.ndarray):
        Positions of the fine_grained trajectory. Assumed to have shape
        (n_frames,n_fg_sites,n_dims).
    cmap (map.LinearMap):
        Configurational map that links the fine-grained and coarse-grained
        resolutions.
    constraints (set of frozensets):
        Set of frozensets, each of which contains a set of fine-grained
        sites which have a molecular constraint applied. Constrained
        groups may overlap.
    outer (positive float):
        The largest distance to consider when making the grid of Gaussians.
    inner (non-negative float):
        The smallest distance to consider when making the grid of Gaussians.
    n_basis (positive integer):
        Number of Gaussian bins to use. Higher numbers are more expressive, but
        increase memory usage.
    width (positive integer):
        Controls the width of each Gaussian. Gaussians are roughly calculated as
        exp(-d**2/width), where d is the distance.
    dist_power (positive float):
        Controls the spacing and scaling of the Gaussians. Values greater than 1
        concentrate Gaussians towards outer, values between 0 and 1 concentrate
        Gaussians towards inner. Areas with more concentrated Gaussians also
        have Gaussians of less variance. See gaussian_dist_basis for more
        information.
    batch_size (positive integer):
        Number of trajectory frames to feed into JAX at once. Larger values are
        faster but use more memory.
    lazy (boolean):
        If truthy, generators of features and divs are returned; else, lists are
        returned.
    div_method (string):
        Determines how the divergence will be calculated; passed to
        gb_subfeat_jac as method.

    Returns:
    -------
    A dictionary with two three elements pairs:
        'feats': list/generator of feature mats (n_frames, n_fg_sites, total_n_feats)
            The features do not changed between frames.
        'divs': list/generator of div mats (n_frames, total_n_feats, n_dim).
            These are filled with zeros as the features do not change as a
            function of position.
        'names': None
    Each element of these lists corresponds to features for a single CG site,
    except for 'names', which may have names which are shared for each cg site
    (or None).
